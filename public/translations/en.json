Its main purpose is to fetch data from an external <blue>API</blue> using the <blue>React Query</blue> library, and then render a portion of that data in this tab. To ensure the quality and reliability of the application, I have implemented tests using the <blue>React Testing Library</blue>. The visual appearance of the application has been implemented using the <blue>Styled Components</blue> library. Additionally, the application's theme state is managed using the <blue>Recoil</blue> library, and it also offers the option to choose a language."
