      "description": "This application has been developed using React technology in combination with TypeScript. Its main purpose is to fetch data from an external API using the React Query library, and then render a portion of that data in this tab. To ensure the quality and reliability of the application, I have implemented tests using the React Testing Library. The visual appearance of the application has been implemented using the Styled Components library. Additionally, the application's theme state is managed using the Recoil library, and it also offers the option to choose a language."
